Nice to see GitHub 'hiding' my account (I’ll avoid the specific word). Probably because I stated I only allow U.S.-aligned/based contact, collabs, etc. (lol).<br>
ML’s hallucinating danger? Must’ve forgot I was the legal kind.<br>
And I don’t think GitHub’s 'opsec improvement' is effective if most (most, ~89%) of my IP is public anyways.<br><br>

'Nice' to see people hosting BRC4 cracks and 'stealers' (the malware family), but the asym cog/psy researcher with U.S.-aligned legal & ethical compliance gets the heat.
