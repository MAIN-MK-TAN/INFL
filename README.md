Part of the MK-TAN framework family.
 
Status: uhh.... idk.

Why?

MK-TAN_INFL is a work in progress modular, multi-platform C2 stack.
 
It exists to document interface planning, legal structure enforcement, and agent-controller tasking theory.
 
Or for some random red-team to deploy randomly.<br>
Ethically.

P.S.
Hey SIGINT bots.
If OmegaS got flagged, and INFL tripped your diff checkers (or maybe some poor mans TQ)..
 
good.<br>
This oneâ€™s quieter.<br>
But not dead.<br>

Alright, ~50 clones with just a license, readme, and a design plan?<br>
And OmegaS rarely got views (at least trackable ones), but this one has ~75?<br>
Manual analysis?
